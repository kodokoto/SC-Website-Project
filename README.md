# Vintage Computing Website (Deadline 22/02)
This assignment will be undertaken in teams of 3 or 4 students. These teams will be confirmed during the second week by Clemence.
The task is to build a simple web site using ONLY HTML and CSS. The web site should have 8 pages if 4 students or 6 pages for groups of 3, including an index page, plus a CSS style sheet for your site.
If you asked for an exception and need to work in a group of 5, your site should have 10 pages.

**No extra marks will be given to websites using additional technologies (eg javascript or server).
Deadline is on the 22nd of February at 5 pm. One submission only per group.**
 
# The brief:
 The topic of the site will be an antique computing system. Your group will be assigned a topic and a target audience from the following list:
# Topics - Vintage computing systems:
- Amstrad CPC
- Nintendo Virtual Boy
- IBM 7090
- Teletext
- Apple Newton
# Target audience:
- 8-10 years old children
- Young adults in a museum
- Silicon Valley entrepreneurs
- Vintage computing collectors
- Makers/tinkerers

You will need to create content and design your website for your audience. This means making the information comprehensible and interesting to those people.

**Note: you can’t just copy-paste content from another website about your topic!!!** 
 
# How to approach this task:
Those are high-level guidelines, feel free to make them your own. Agreeing on a clear plan and splitting the tasks in your group will be key to the success of your project.
- **Step 1**: Research your target audience
	- Who are they? 
  - What are their needs and expectations?
	- Think about how this will impact your content, design and tone of voice
- **Step 2**: Research the topic and design your content
  - Decide what the website should entail and what content is needed to meet the needs of your target audience. This includes text, images, potential videos, links to other resources, etc.
- **Step 3**: Define a structure for your site
	- How should the content be organised? 
  - What is the information architecture of the site?
	- What should go on which page? 
  - What is the layout of the pages? 
- **Step 4**: Build an HTML skeleton
	- Create an outline of your website’s structure in HTML. Create key elements and sub-pages.
- **Step 5**: Design and style your website
	- What should your website look like? Make a decision on look and feel, colours, etc. 
	   - Start applying some CSS.
- **Step 6**: Iterate, test and finalise
	- Iterate on your content, code and styles. 
     - Make sure you test your code regularly so there are no errors.
 
# What to submit:
### You need to submit 2 files in total:
- Code and source files (.zip):
  - Upload one .zip file containing all the files folders needed to run your website:
	  - Index.html
	  - All other .html page
	  - .css file
	  - Any other source files/folders (eg images)
**If your website uses a specific folder structure, please make sure to include the same structure in your .zip file. Only one submission is needed per group.**

- Group breakdown document:
  - You'll also need to submit a file showing the breakdown of the tasks in your group (who did what!).
