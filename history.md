|The story of the Virtual Boy began not in Japan, but in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Around 1985 an engineer named Allen Becker came up with the idea of using LEDs to create a head-mounted personal display. Dubbed a Scanned Linear Array (SLA), the device was cheap, easy to mass-produce and had multiple applications; Becker saw it as a means of viewing information when both hands were needed to do other work. For example, doctors could use it to check vital signs or scans during surgery.|The story that led to the Virtual Boy coming around was actually started in America, Massachusetts.
