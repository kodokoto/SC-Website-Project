                    <h1>The Journey Begins</h1>
                    <p>  The story of the Virtual Boy began not in Japan, but in Cambridge,
                        Massachusetts. Around 1985 an engineer named Allen Becker came up with the
                        idea of using LEDs to create a head-mounted personal display. Dubbed a Scanned
                        Linear Array (SLA), the device was cheap, easy to mass-produce and had multiple
                        applications; Becker saw it as a means of viewing information when both hands were
                        needed to do other work. For example, doctors could use it to check vital signs or
                        scans during surgery.

                        technology was shown off at various trade shows but no progress was made on
                        turning it into a viable, selling product - until the virtual reality boom happened.

                    <p> Nintendo enthusiastically received the Private Eye, as led by Gunpei
                        Yokoi. He saw this as a unique technology that competitors would find difficult to
                        emulate. Nintendo entered into an exclusive agreement with Reflection Technology,
                        Inc. to license the technology for its displays. Yokoi was 49 years old, and suddenly,
                        an unexpected opportunity to move Nintendo in a new direction landed right in
                        front of him. It put his retirement plans on hold.
                        Additionally, the resulting game console was intended to enhance Nintendo's
                        reputation as an innovator and to "encourage more creativity" in
                        games. Codenaming the project "VR32".

                        Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation, while Nintendo’s own next-gen contender,
                        the Ultra 64 (later renamed Nintendo 64), would not be ready until 1996.
                        Yamauchi encouraged R&D1 to complete the Virtual Boy and ready it for release
                        as soon as possible to buy time prior to the launch of the Nintendo 64.

                    <p> The Virtual Boy made its U.S. debut at the Winter CES show in
                        Las Vegas. Few large media outlets criticized the system before its release,
                        expressing guarded optimism on behalf of the monstrously successful Nintendo.
                        Meanwhile, the enthusiast press on the nascent web didn’t pull any punches. “My
                        biggest beef is Nintendo trying to pass this off to the public as virtual reality. It’s
                        not,” wrote Michael Lambert for an early online video game fanzine after trying the
                        Virtual Boy at CES.

                    <h1> Ready! Set! Liftoff?.</h1>
                    <p> In the months leading up to the Virtual Boy’s launch in Japan, the
                        media there seized onto Nintendo’s health and eyesight warnings and
                        sensationalized them, implying that the Virtual Boy was definitely bad for players’
                        eyes.
                        It should be no surprise then, that when the Virtual Boy launched in Japan, the
                        system was met with little enthusiasm. Unlike the Super Famicom, which had seen
                        shoppers line up on the street waiting to buy a system, no one lined up for the
                        Virtual Boy.

                    <p>  Luckily for Nintendo of America, the American press had not
                        piled on the Virtual Boy for health reasons, so when it launched for $179.95, sales
                        seemed brisk at first. In the U.S, Nintendo had partnered with Blockbuster to rent
                        out Virtual Boy systems so people could try it for themselves, a unique strategy to
                        get around the difficultly of conveying the system’s 3D effect in print and TV
                        advertising.

                        In Japan things were looking dim for the system. By
                        December, it had sold only 140,000 units in its home country, a deeply
                        embarrassing failure by Nintendo standards. Yamauchi decided to pull the plug on
                        the Virtual Boy in Japan–only six months after its release–so as to not expend any
                        more money on an obvious flop.

                        once and for all. Virtual Boy began showing up in the clearance aisles of toy stores
                        like Toys “R” Us for $30 or less. Back in Massachusetts, Reflection Technology
                        reeled at the turn of events. Most shocked of all was Allen Becker, who had
                        essentially bet the company on the success of the Virtual Boy.

                    <p> Reflection Technology, which had hoped to parlay the system into an IPO.
                        FaxView went into production in late 1995, but it failed to take off, so the firm
                        sought more investments and hunkered down into research mode but the failure of
                        the Virtual Boy hit the company hard, and the FaxView also flopped at retail. The firm
                        was apparently working on a full-colour version of its technology around 1997, but
                        ran out of cash before it could bring the device to market.

                    <h1> Becoming a legacy</h1>
                    <p> Ever restless, founder Al Becker soon moved on to another venture involved
                        with water purification technology for developing nations. This quest was cut short
                        when, on October 14, 2001, he died unexpectedly at his home of a ruptured artery
                        while watching TV. He was 53.
                        For both Yokoi and Becker, the flawed brilliance of the Virtual Boy is part of an
                        impressive legacy—daring launch, stunning failure, and all.
